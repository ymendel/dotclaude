# Miscellaneous Rules

Overflow from rules that don't fit elsewhere.

## Scope searches to the known location

When searching for a file or pattern, start from the most specific known directory — not a broad ancestor. Searching from a parent directory is slower, noisier, and risks touching unintended paths. If the search fails, widen incrementally.

Also: when the target path is a symlink, `find` may not follow it without a trailing slash. Use `find /path/to/symlink/ ...` (with trailing slash) to ensure the symlink is resolved.
