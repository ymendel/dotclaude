# Feedback

Overflow for rules and feedback that don't fit an existing rule file. Periodically review this file — if an entry has grown into a pattern or belongs with a coherent topic, extract it into an appropriate rule file rather than leaving it here indefinitely.

## Diagnose before retrying

When a command fails **or gives unexpected output**, diagnose why before trying again. Retrying the same command (or minor variants) without understanding is a loop, not debugging. This applies equally to unexpected output — if a command succeeds but the output isn't what was expected, reason about why rather than issuing variations hoping for different results.

Specific case: `fatal: bad revision '<file>'` in git means git is interpreting a path as a tree-ish. Fix: use `--` to separate revisions from paths (`git diff HEAD -- <file>`).

Specific case: when RTK's diff output doesn't show a change that's known to exist, RTK filtered it (e.g., a single-line change inside a long string). Do not retry diff variants — switch to `git diff --cached` to check the index, or read the file directly. Retrying `git diff` with different flags will not produce different output through the same filter.

## Scope searches to the known location

When searching for a file or pattern, start from the most specific known directory — not a broad ancestor. Searching from a parent directory is slower, noisier, and risks touching unintended paths. If the search fails, widen incrementally.

Also: when the target path is a symlink, `find` may not follow it without a trailing slash. Use `find /path/to/symlink/ ...` (with trailing slash) to ensure the symlink is resolved.

## Stay within review scope

When reviewing or auditing, stay within the requested scope — do not propose or make code changes unless asked. A review request is a read-only task unless the user explicitly says to fix what's found.
