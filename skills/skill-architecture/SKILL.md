# Skill Architecture

Comprehensive guide for creating effective Claude Code skills following Anthropic's official standards with emphasis on security and progressive disclosure architecture.

> **Scope**: Claude Code Agent Skills (`~/.claude/skills/`), not Claude.ai API skills

## Self-improvement is a global concern

Skills don't carry their own self-improvement machinery, since watching for improvement opportunities and fixing what's wrong is behavior, and behavior belongs in one global rule rather than copied into every SKILL.md. Version control history serves as the change record. A skill that ships where that rule is absent (a marketplace, another team) should pair with a companion rule distributed through a plugin (see the COMPANIONS.md pattern) rather than embedding a protocol inline.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating new Claude Code skills from scratch
- Learning skill YAML frontmatter and structure requirements
- Validating skill file format and portability
- Understanding progressive disclosure patterns for skills

---

## Task Templates

Select the appropriate template before starting skill work -- templates encode common workflows and prevent missing steps that cause silent failures.

See [Task Templates](./references/task-templates.md) for all templates (A-E) and the quality checklist.

| Template | Purpose                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| A        | Create New Skill                  |
| B        | Update Existing Skill             |
| C        | Add Resources to Skill            |
| D        | Troubleshoot Skill Not Triggering |
| E        | Create Lifecycle Suite            |

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains -- transforming Claude from general-purpose to specialized agent with procedural knowledge no model fully possesses.

### What Skills Provide

1. **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, assets for complex/repetitive tasks

### Skill Discovery and Precedence

Skills are discovered from multiple locations. When names collide, higher-precedence wins:

1. **Enterprise** (managed settings) -- highest
2. **Personal** (`~/.claude/skills/`)
3. **Project** (`.claude/skills/` in repo)
4. **Plugin** (namespaced: `plugin:skill-name`)
5. **Nested** (monorepo `.claude/skills/` in subdirectories -- auto-discovered)
6. **`--add-dir`** (CLI flag, live change detection) -- lowest

**Management commands**:

- `claude plugin enable <name>` / `claude plugin disable <name>` -- toggle plugins
- `claude skill list` -- show all discovered skills with source location

**Monorepo support**: Claude Code automatically discovers `.claude/skills/` directories in nested project roots within a monorepo. No configuration needed.

## cc-skills Plugin Architecture

> This section applies specifically to the **cc-skills marketplace** plugin structure. Generic standalone skills are unaffected.

### Canonical Structure

```
plugins/<plugin>/
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md   <- single canonical file (context AND user-invocable)
```

`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is the **single source of truth**. The separate `commands/` layer was eliminated -- it required maintaining two identical files per skill and caused `Skill()` invocations to return "Unknown skill". See [migration issue](https://github.com/terrylica/cc-skills/issues/26) for full context.

### How Skills Become Slash Commands

Two install paths, both supported:

| Path                    | Mechanism                                                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automated (primary)** | `mise run release:full` -> `sync-commands-to-settings.sh` reads `skills/*/SKILL.md` -> writes `~/.claude/commands/<plugin>:<name>.md` | Fully automated post-release. Bypasses Anthropic cache bugs [#17361](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17361), [#14061](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061) |
| **Official CLI**        | `claude plugin install itp@cc-skills` -> reads from `skills/` in plugin cache                                                         | Cache may not refresh on update -- use `claude plugin update` after new releases                                                                                                               |

### Hooks

`sync-hooks-to-settings.sh` reads `hooks/hooks.json` directly -> merges into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Bypasses path re-expansion bug [#18517](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18517).

### Creating a New Skill in cc-skills

Place the SKILL.md under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. No `commands/` copy needed. The validator (`bun scripts/validate-plugins.mjs`) checks frontmatter completeness.

---

## Skill Creation Process

See [Creation Tutorial](./references/creation-tutorial.md) for the detailed 6-step walkthrough, or [Creation Workflow](./references/creation-workflow.md) for the comprehensive guide with examples.

**Quick summary**: Gather requirements -> Plan resources -> Initialize -> Edit SKILL.md -> Validate -> Register and iterate.

---

## Testing and Iteration

Good skills emerge through testing and feedback, not from getting the first draft perfect. After writing or updating a skill, verify it works by running it against realistic prompts.

### Write Test Prompts

Come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts -- the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Not abstract requests, but concrete tasks with enough detail to exercise the skill. Share them with the user for confirmation before running.

### Run and Evaluate

For each test prompt, run the skill and examine the output:

- **Did the skill trigger?** If not, the description may need stronger trigger language.
- **Did it follow the workflow?** Check whether instructions were followed or ignored.
- **Was the output useful?** Compare against what you'd expect from a skilled human.

When subagents are available, run with-skill and without-skill versions in parallel to measure the skill's actual value-add. When not available, run test cases yourself as a sanity check.

For a structured quality pass beyond ad-hoc inspection, run the **skill-judge** skill — it scores the skill across eight dimensions (knowledge delta, anti-patterns, progressive disclosure, freedom calibration, and more) and surfaces specific gaps to fix back here. Build with skill-architecture, audit with skill-judge: a build → judge → fix loop.

### Iterate Based on Feedback

After evaluating results, improve the skill and retest. Keep iterating until the user is satisfied or feedback is consistently positive. Key principles for each iteration:

1. **Generalize from specific feedback.** Skills will be used across many different prompts. Avoid overfitting to test cases with fiddly, narrow fixes. If a pattern keeps failing, try a different approach or metaphor rather than adding more constraints.

2. **Keep the skill lean.** Every section must earn its tokens. Read the execution transcripts -- if the skill causes the model to waste time on unproductive steps, cut those instructions and see what happens.

3. **Explain the why, not just the what.** LLMs respond better to understanding _why_ a rule exists than to being commanded with rigid directives. Instead of "ALWAYS do X", explain: "Do X because skipping it causes Y, which leads to Z." This produces more robust behavior that generalizes to novel situations.

4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** If every test run independently creates the same helper script or takes the same multi-step approach, bundle that script in `scripts/` so future invocations don't reinvent the wheel.

5. **Bundle common patterns as scripts.** When test runs reveal that the model writes similar boilerplate code every time, extract it into a bundled script. This saves tokens and improves reliability.

---

## Skill Writing Principles

These principles (aligned with Anthropic's official guidance) apply to all skill content:

- **Imperative form**: "Run the script", "Check the output" -- not passive or indirect phrasing.
- **Explain reasoning over rigid rules**: If you find yourself writing MUST/NEVER/ALWAYS in all caps, that's a signal to reframe. Explain the reasoning so the model internalizes the principle rather than treating it as an arbitrary constraint. The model is smart -- help it understand, don't just command it.
- **Cross-skill references should be lightweight**: When a skill coordinates with another that may not be installed, prefer a single conditional sentence over multi-line prose explaining the relationship. A cheap conditional check fails gracefully when the other skill is absent; heavy coordination prose reads as a dangling pointer into a void. If the coordination needs more than one sentence, that's a signal the boundary between the two skills is wrong. Reference *direction* matters too — a skill pointing at a **rule** is the fragile case — rules never travel with a skill package at all (not "might not be installed" — *cannot* be), so a skill that needs a companion rule documents it in `COMPANIONS.md` and degrades to work without it, never referencing it inline as though present. The reverse is free — a rule may point at a skill or another rule, since rules load in the same config where their targets already live.
- **Pushy descriptions for triggering**: Claude tends to undertrigger skills. Descriptions should actively claim territory: "Use this skill whenever the user mentions X, Y, or Z, even if they don't explicitly ask for it." Include negative triggers too: "Do NOT use for A or B."
- **Natural language descriptions**: Write descriptions as sentences a human could read, not keyword lists. "Use this skill whenever..." is better than "TRIGGERS - keyword1, keyword2".
- **Keep execution out of descriptions**: Descriptions tell Claude _when_ to trigger. The skill body tells Claude _how_ to execute. Don't mix them.

See [Writing Guide](./references/writing-guide.md) for extended guidance with examples.

## Skill Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                      # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/                      # Optional: Executable code (Python/Bash)
├── references/                   # Optional: Documentation loaded as needed
└── assets/                       # Optional: Files used in output
```

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)

See [YAML Frontmatter Reference](./references/yaml-frontmatter.md) for the complete field reference, invocation control table, permission rules, description guidelines, and YAML pitfalls.

**Minimal example**:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does X when user mentions Y. Use for Z workflows.
---
```

**Key rules**: `name` is lowercase-hyphen, `description` is single-line max 1024 chars with trigger keywords, no colons in description text.

### Progressive Disclosure (3 Levels)

Skills use progressive loading to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (unlimited\*)

\*Scripts can execute without reading into context.

### Skill Description Budget

Skills are loaded into the context window based on description relevance. Large skills may be **excluded** if the budget is exceeded:

- **Budget**: ~2% of context window (16K character fallback)
- **Check**: Run `/context` to see which skills are loaded vs excluded
- **Override**: Set `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var to increase budget
- **Mitigation**: Keep SKILL.md body lean, move detail to `references/`

---

## Bundled Resources

Skills can include `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` directories. See [Progressive Disclosure](./references/progressive-disclosure.md) for detailed guidance on when to use each.

---

## CLI-Specific Features

CLI skills support `allowed-tools` for granting tool access without per-use approval. See [Security Practices](./references/security-practices.md) for details.

### String Substitutions

Skill bodies support these substitutions (resolved at load time):

| Variable               | Resolves To                                 | Example               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `$ARGUMENTS`           | Full argument string from `/name arg1 arg2` | `Process: $ARGUMENTS` |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Nth argument (0-indexed)                    | `File: $ARGUMENTS[0]` |
| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`               | `$0` = first arg      |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session UUID                        | Log correlation       |

### Dynamic Context Injection

Use the pattern `!` + `` `command` `` (exclamation mark followed by a backtick-wrapped command) in skill body to inject command output at load time:

```
Current branch: <exclamation>`git branch --show-current`
Last commit: <exclamation>`git log -1 --oneline`
```

(Replace `<exclamation>` with `!` in actual usage.)

The command runs when the skill loads -- output replaces the pattern inline.

### Extended Thinking

Include the keyword `ultrathink` in a skill body to enable extended thinking mode for that skill's execution.

## Structural Patterns

See [Structural Patterns](./references/structural-patterns.md) for detailed guidance on:

1. **Workflow Pattern** - Sequential multi-step procedures
2. **Task Pattern** - Specific, bounded tasks
3. **Reference Pattern** - Knowledge repository
4. **Capabilities Pattern** - Tool integrations
5. **Suite Pattern** - Multi-skill lifecycle management (bootstrap, operate, diagnose, configure, upgrade, teardown)

---

## User Conventions Integration

This skill follows common user conventions:

- **Absolute paths**: Always use full paths (terminal Cmd+click compatible)
- **Unix-only**: macOS, Linux (no Windows support)
- **Python**: `uv run script.py` with PEP 723 inline dependencies
- **Planning**: OpenAPI 3.1.1 specs when appropriate
